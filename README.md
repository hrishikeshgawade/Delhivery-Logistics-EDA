# Delhivery-Logistics-EDA
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on Delhivery, a leading logistics and supply chain services company in India. The project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset to uncover insights into trip efficiency, route optimization, and delivery performance.

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on Delhivery, a prominent logistics and supply chain services company in India. The project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset to uncover insights into trip efficiency, route optimization, and delivery performance.

## Objectives
- Data cleaning and manipulation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Visualization of key features through histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.
- Identification of patterns and relationships between various factors affecting delivery times.
- Feature engineering to enhance predictive modeling capabilities.
- Formulation and testing of hypotheses related to delivery time efficiency and route types.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `delhivery.csv`, which contains various attributes related to delivery trips, including:
- Trip creation time
- Route type
- Actual delivery time
- Distance to destination
- And more...

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed: bash, pip, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Delhivery-Logistics-EDA.git
   cd Delhivery-Logistics-EDA
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Eda_final.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook to explore the data and visualize the findings.

## Key Findings
- Many features exhibit right-skewed distributions, particularly time and distance-related variables.
- Strong positive correlations were observed between actual delivery time and distance-related features.
- Outliers were identified and handled to improve data quality.

## Next Steps
- Build predictive models to forecast delivery times.
- Incorporate external data (e.g., weather, traffic) to enhance predictions.
- Continuously monitor and update the model based on new data.
